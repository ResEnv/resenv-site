        "description": "A large mylar balloon has been bonded to a piezoelectric foil sheet so it can act as both a microphone and a loudspeaker. A set of electronics has been designed for the balloon to detect significant audio activity, and play a selection from a set of prerecorded audio samples when the activity ceases,essentially enabling one to have a “dialog” with the balloon. Over 50 such balloon systems were produced and installed all over the Weisner Building for the Media Lab’s 10’th anniversary celebration.",
